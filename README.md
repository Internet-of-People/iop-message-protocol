# IoP Message Protocol

The protocol is defined and documented in Google Protobuf v3 [IopHomeNode.proto3](IopHomeNode.proto3) file. 

The status of the tests can be found in [TESTS.md](TESTS.md) file. 

[IopHomeNode.proto2](IopHomeNode.proto2) file contains Protobuf v2 definition of very small subset of the protocol, which is only used for the Rust implementation proof of concept.
