//
// Definition of IoP Proximity Server network protocol.
// We strictly use only features that are binary compatible in ProtoBuf v2 and v3.
// We use no v2 or v3 specific features.
//
// An integral part of the protocol are the protocol tests:
// https://github.com/Internet-of-People/message-protocol/blob/master/TESTS.md
// The tests must comply with this protocol file, but may add some additional requirements
// or constraints on the behavior of a compatible software.
//
//
//
// * Profile Server Network Protocol Inheritance *
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Proximity Server network protocol is created using the same basic principles as Profile Server network protocol.
// Please see the Roles, Reused Types and Conversations sections of Profile Server network protocol protofile 
// (https://github.com/Internet-of-People/message-protocol/blob/master/IopProfileServer.proto) for more information 
// about these common concepts. Also see there descriptions of using ListRolesRequest, StartConversationRequest 
// and VerifyIdentityRequest requests as these are replicated in the Proximity Server network protocol as well.
//
// Proximity Server implements the following server roles:
//
//   * Primary Interface = "primary"
//   * Neighbors Interface = "neighbor"
//   * Clients Interface = "client"
//

// There is a 1 byte prefix because of Google Protobuf protocol, so the actual binary data for a message
// with body size 4660 bytes would be:
//
//
//   0D 34 12 00 00

// where 0x0D means type 'fixed32' (which value is 5) + index of 'header', which is 1 << 3,

// Initiates sharing of the activity database with a neighbor proximity server.
//
// Proximity server joining the network needs to contact its neighbors and ask them to share their 
// activity databases, so that it can include their activities into its own search queries.
// Similarly, proximity servers that detect a new neighbor in their neighborhood need to contact 
// it and ask it to share its activity database with them.
//
// Sharing the activity list always goes from one proximity server S (who acts as the server in 
// the session) to the requesting proximity server C (who acts as a client in the session). It is C 
// who connects to S and sends a request asking S to share its database. If the server C wants 
// to share its activity database with the server S, it has to wait for the request from S, which 
// will ask it to share its database. This request will come if S considers C its neighbor.
//
// The process starts with the server C sending StartNeighborhoodInitializationRequest message to S.
// If S accepts the request, it replies with StartNeighborhoodInitializationResponse and then 
// it starts sending NeighborhoodSharedActivityUpdateRequest messages until a full database is sent 
// to C. With each update message, C has to check the validity of the data and if it accepts 
// the batch it replies with NeighborhoodSharedActivityUpdateResponse. Once all of the activties are 
// sent to C, S sends FinishNeighborhoodInitializationRequest and if C replies with successful 
// message FinishNeighborhoodInitializationResponse, the process is completed. 
//
// If S is not the primary proximity server for any activities yet, it may send 
// FinishNeighborhoodInitializationRequest message without sending any 
// NeighborhoodSharedActivityUpdateRequest messages.
//
// Once C replies with FinishNeighborhoodInitializationResponse, the initialization process is 
// finished and C can consider the activities hosted on S in its search queries. If a connection 
// is terminated or the process is disrupted in any other way, C can not consider the process 
// as finished and must not include the activities of S in its searches.
//
// The proximity server S has the responsibility of keeping the information on C up to date. With 
// each change of an activity, for which S is the primary proximity server, except for changes that 
// do not require neighborhood updates, it has to contact C and inform it about the change. 
// This is done using NeighborhoodSharedActivityUpdateRequest messages that are sent outside 
// the initialization process (i.e. without sending StartNeighborhoodInitializationRequest message 
// first).
//
// If StartNeighborhoodInitializationRequest message is processed successfully, the initialization 
// of the neighbor relationship is started on the opened session and the initialization process has 
// to be finished with FinishNeighborhoodInitializationRequest or it will fail when the connection 
// is terminated.

// delete them from its database. Activities of a neighbor proximity server can also be deleted if 
// the proximity server no longer considers the neighbor as its neighbor.

// CAN Integration
//
// CAN provides globally accessible distribute storage that is used for multiple purposes in IoP. From proximity 
// server's point of view, the most important use case is implementation of indexing that allows IoP users 
// to find other proximity servers only using their network identifier. 
//
// A proximity server publishes its contact information in CAN when it is started for the first time. It also 
// creates a so called IPNS record that maps the proximity server network ID to this contact information record 
// and thus allows anyone to find the contact information known just the network ID of the proximity server.
//
// CAN data objects are immutable. The proximity server is responsible for deleting the old object from CAN when 
// it wants to replace it by a new object. When the proximity server's contact information changes, the proximity 
// server asks CAN to delete the old contact information object and publishes a new contact information object.
// Then it has to submit a new IPNS to point to the new object.
//
// IPNS records expire in time and must be refreshed. This is done by creating a new IPNS record by the IPNS 
// record owner and replacing the old version of the record with the new one. If an IPNS record expires, it 
// becomes invalid and will be discarded by CAN network.
//
// IPNS records has to be signed by the private key of its owner, otherwise they are invalid. This requirement 
// prevents malicious manipulations of IPNS records.
