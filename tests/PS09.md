##### Description 

The test stores object in CAN and sets its IPNS record to point to this object,
then it refreshes the IPNS record, changes the CAN object and refreshes the IPNS record again.
Finally, it deletes the CAN object.


###### Step 1:

  * `CanPublishIpnsRecordRequest.record.signature` is set to a valid signature of this IPNS record.

and reads the response. 


###### Step 3:

The test connects to CAN server and invokes name resolve API:

  * `/api/v0/name/resolve?arg=$name`, where $name is set to CAN ID of the test's identity

and reads the response:

  `{ "Path": "$path" }`

       { key := "key3", boolValue := false },
       { key := "keyX", binaryValue is set to 500,000 bytes 0x40 },
     ]`
  * `$IdentityData2 := CanStoreDataRequest.data`
 
and reads the response in form of *CanStoreDataResponse*:

  * `$ObjectHash2 := CanStoreDataResponse.hash`
