### HN00xxx - General Protocol Tests

#### HN00001 - Invalid Message Header 

##### Prerequisites/Inputs

###### Inputs:
  
  * Node's IP address
  * Node's primary port

##### Description 

The test sends a message to the node that does not represent a valid Protobuf message for IoP protocol.

###### Step 1:
The test connects to the primary port of the node ands sends binary data:

`46 84 21 46 87`

and reads the response.


##### Acceptance Criteria

###### Step 1:
Node replies with *Response*:

  * `Response.status == ERROR_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`
  
and then the node closes the connection.




  
#### HN00002 - Invalid Message Body

##### Prerequisites/Inputs

###### Inputs:

  * Node's IP address
  * Node's primary port

##### Description 

The test sends a message to the node that does not represent a valid Protobuf message for IoP protocol.

###### Step 1:
The test connects to the primary port of the node and sends binary data:

`0D 04 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF`

and reads the response.



##### Acceptance Criteria

###### Step 1:
Node replies with *Response*:

  * `Response.status == ERROR_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`

and then the node closes the connection.

  




#### HN00003 - Disconnection of Inactive TCP Client from Primary Port - No Message

##### Prerequisites/Inputs

###### Inputs:

  * Node's IP address
  * Node's primary port

##### Description 

The test connects to the node and does not send any message. This should be detected as an inactive connection by the node after a while.
 
###### Step 1:
The test connects to the primary port of the node and waits 500 seconds. The test then attempts to send *PingRequest*:

  * `Message.id := 1`
  * `SingleRequest.version := [1,0,0]`
  * `PingRequest.payload = "test"`

and reads the response.


##### Acceptance Criteria

###### Step 1:

Node disconnects the test and the attempt to send *PingRequest* or read the response fails.







#### HN00004 - Disconnection of Inactive TCP Client from Primary Port - Incomplete Header

##### Prerequisites/Inputs

###### Inputs:
  * Node's IP address
  * Node's primary port

##### Description 

The test sends incomplete message header to the node and waits. This should be detected as an inactive connection by the node after a while. 

###### Step 1:

The test connects to the primary port of the node and creates the following *PingRequest*:

  * `Message.id := 1`
  * `SingleRequest.version := [1,0,0]`
  * `PingRequest.payload = "test"`

but it only sends first 4 bytes of this message to the node and then it waits 500 seconds. Then it attempts to send the rest of the message and reads the response.


##### Acceptance Criteria

###### Step 1:

Node disconnects the test and this prevents the test to send the second part of the message or read a response.

##### Prerequisites/Inputs

###### Inputs:

###### Step 1:

The test connects to the primary port of the node and creates the following *PingRequest*:

  * `Message.id := 1`
  * `SingleRequest.version := [1,0,0]`
  * `PingRequest.payload = "test"`

but it only sends first 6 bytes of this message to the node and then it waits 500 seconds. Then it attempts to send the rest of the message and reads the response.


##### Acceptance Criteria

###### Step 1:

Node disconnects the test and this prevents the test to send the second part of the message or read a response.

##### Prerequisites/Inputs

###### Inputs:

  * Node's clNonCustomer port

##### Description 

The tests connects to the node and sends no message. This should be detected as an inactive connection by the node after a while.

###### Step 1:
The test creates a TLS connection to the clNonCustomer port of the node and waits 180 seconds. Then it sends *PingRequest*:

  * `Message.id := 1`
  * `SingleRequest.version := [1,0,0]`
  * `PingRequest.payload = "test"`

and reads the response.


##### Acceptance Criteria

###### Step 1:

Node disconnects the test and the attempt to send *PingRequest* or read the response fails.

  * Node's clNonCustomer port

##### Description 

The test connects to TLS encrypted port of the node and does not initiate TLS handshake and waits. This should be detected as an inactive connection by the node after a while.

###### Step 1:

The test creates a TCP connection to the clNonCustomer port and does not initiate TLS handshake. Then it waits 180 seconds. Then it attempts to initiate the TLS handshake.

##### Acceptance Criteria

###### Step 1:

Node disconnects the test before it attempts to initiate the TLS handshake and the test will then be unable to complete it.







#### HN00010 - Message Too Large

##### Prerequisites/Inputs

###### Inputs:
  * Node's IP address
  * Node's primary port

##### Description 

The test sends a message larger than the protocol's maximal message size limit of 1 MB.

  * `SingleRequest.version := [1,0,0]`
  * `PingRequest.payload` is set to a sequence of 1,048,576 times 'a'

and reads the response. Then it sends *PingRequest*:

  * `Message.id := 1`
  * `SingleRequest.version := [1,0,0]`

and reads the response.


##### Acceptance Criteria

###### Step 1:

Node replies with *Response*:
  
  * `Response.status == ERROR_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`

and then the node closes the connection, so that sending the second *PingRequest* or receiving a response to it fails.
