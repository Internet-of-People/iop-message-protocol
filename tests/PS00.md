### PS00xxx - General Protocol Tests

#### PS00001 - Invalid Message Header 

##### Prerequisites/Inputs

###### Inputs:
  
  * Server's IP address
  * Server's primary port

##### Description 

The test sends a message to the profile server that does not represent a valid Protobuf message for IoP protocol.

###### Step 1:
The test connects to the primary port of the profile server ands sends binary data:

`46 84 21 46 87`

and reads the response.


##### Acceptance Criteria

###### Step 1:
Server replies with *Response*:

  * `Response.status == ERROR_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`
  
and then the server closes the connection.




  
#### PS00002 - Invalid Message Body

##### Prerequisites/Inputs

###### Inputs:

  * Server's IP address
  * Server's primary port

##### Description 

The test sends a message to the profile server that does not represent a valid Protobuf message for IoP protocol.

###### Step 1:
The test connects to the primary port of the profile server and sends binary data:

`0D 04 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF`

and reads the response.



##### Acceptance Criteria

###### Step 1:
Server replies with *Response*:

  * `Response.status == ERROR_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`

and then the profile server closes the connection.

  




#### PS00003 - Disconnection of Inactive TCP Client from Primary Port - No Message

##### Prerequisites/Inputs

###### Inputs:

  * Server's IP address
  * Server's primary port

##### Description 

The test connects to the profile server and does not send any message. This should be detected as an inactive connection by the profile server after a while.
 
###### Step 1:
The test connects to the primary port of the profile server and waits 500 seconds. The test then attempts to send *PingRequest*:

  * `Message.id := 1`
  * `SingleRequest.version := [1,0,0]`
  * `PingRequest.payload = "test"`

and reads the response.


##### Acceptance Criteria

###### Step 1:

Profile server disconnects the test and the attempt to send *PingRequest* or read the response fails.







#### PS00004 - Disconnection of Inactive TCP Client from Primary Port - Incomplete Header

##### Prerequisites/Inputs

###### Inputs:
  * Server's IP address
  * Server's primary port

##### Description 

The test sends incomplete message header to the profile server and waits. This should be detected as an inactive connection by the profile server after a while. 

###### Step 1:

The test connects to the primary port of the profile server and creates the following *PingRequest*:

  * `Message.id := 1`
  * `SingleRequest.version := [1,0,0]`
  * `PingRequest.payload = "test"`

but it only sends first 4 bytes of this message to the profile server and then it waits 500 seconds. Then it attempts to send the rest of the message and reads the response.


##### Acceptance Criteria

###### Step 1:

Profile server disconnects the test and this prevents the test to send the second part of the message or read a response.








#### PS00005 - Disconnection of Inactive TCP Client from Primary Port - Incomplete Message

##### Prerequisites/Inputs

###### Inputs:

##### Description 

The test sends an incomplete message body to the profile server and waits. This should be detected as an inactive connection by the profile server after a while.

###### Step 1:

The test connects to the primary port of the profile server and creates the following *PingRequest*:

  * `Message.id := 1`
  * `SingleRequest.version := [1,0,0]`
  * `PingRequest.payload = "test"`

but it only sends first 6 bytes of this message to the profile server and then it waits 500 seconds. Then it attempts to send the rest of the message and reads the response.


##### Acceptance Criteria

###### Step 1:

Profile server disconnects the test and this prevents the test to send the second part of the message or read a response.

##### Description 

The tests connects to the profile server and sends no message. This should be detected as an inactive connection by the profile server after a while.

###### Step 1:
The test creates a TLS connection to the clNonCustomer port of the profile server and waits 180 seconds. Then it sends *PingRequest*:

  * `Message.id := 1`
  * `SingleRequest.version := [1,0,0]`
  * `PingRequest.payload = "test"`

and reads the response.


##### Acceptance Criteria

###### Step 1:

Profile server disconnects the test and the attempt to send *PingRequest* or read the response fails.

  * `SingleRequest.version := [1,0,0]`
  * `PingRequest.payload` is set to a sequence of 1,048,576 times 'a'
