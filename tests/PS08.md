### PS08xxx - Neighborhood Related Functionality Tests

#### PS08001 - Neighborhood Related Calls - Unauthorized

##### Prerequisites/Inputs

###### Inputs:
  * Server's IP address
  * Server's srNeighbor port

##### Description 

The test sends *StartNeighborhoodInitializationRequest*, *FinishNeighborhoodInitializationRequest*, *NeighborhoodSharedProfileUpdateRequest*,
*StopNeighborhoodUpdatesRequest* to the profile server without verifying its identity first.


###### Step 1:

The test connects to the srNeighbor port of the profile server and sends *StartNeighborhoodInitializationRequest*:

  * `Message.id := 1`
  * `StartNeighborhoodInitializationRequest.primaryPort := 1`
  * `StartNeighborhoodInitializationRequest.srNeighborPort := 1`
 
and reads the response. Then it sends *FinishNeighborhoodInitializationRequest*:

  * `Message.id := 2`

and reads the response. Then it sends *NeighborhoodSharedProfileUpdateRequest*:

  * `Message.id := 3`
  * `NeighborhoodSharedProfileUpdateRequest.items = []`

and reads the response. Then it sends *StopNeighborhoodUpdatesRequest*:

  * `Message.id := 4`

and reads the response.


##### Acceptance Criteria

###### Step 1:

Server replies with *Response*:
  
  * `Message.id == 1`
  * `Response.status == ERROR_UNAUTHORIZED`

Server replies with *Response*:
  
  * `Message.id == 2`
  * `Response.status == ERROR_UNAUTHORIZED`

Server replies with *Response*:
  
  * `Message.id == 3`
  * `Response.status == ERROR_UNAUTHORIZED`

Server replies with *Response*:
  
  * `Message.id == 4`
  * `Response.status == ERROR_UNAUTHORIZED`








#### PS08002 - Neighborhood Initialization Process - No Profiles

##### Prerequisites/Inputs
  * Server's database is empty.

###### Inputs:
  * Server's IP address
  * Server's primary port


##### Description 

The test starts the neighborhood initialization process with the profile server, which does not host any profiles.


###### Step 1:

The tests obtains a list of service ports from the profile server's primary port and connects 
to profile server's srNeighbor port and verifies its identity. 


###### Step 2:

The test sends *StartNeighborhoodInitializationRequest*:

  * `Message.id := 3`
  * `StartNeighborhoodInitializationRequest.primaryPort := 1`
  * `StartNeighborhoodInitializationRequest.srNeighborPort := 1`
 
and reads the response. Then it waits for *FinishNeighborhoodInitializationRequest* message:

  * `$Id := Message.Id`

and replies with *FinishNeighborhoodInitializationResponse*:

  * `Message.id := $Id`



##### Acceptance Criteria


###### Step 1:

The test successfully obtains list of ports on which the profile server provides its services. 
Then the test successfully verifies its identity.


###### Step 2:

Server replies with *StartNeighborhoodInitializationResponse*:
  
  * `Message.id == 3`
  * `Response.status == STATUS_OK`

Server sends *FinishNeighborhoodInitializationRequest*.
  









#### PS08003 - Neighborhood Initialization Process - Small Set

##### Prerequisites/Inputs
  * Server's database is empty.
  * "images/PS08003.jpg" file exists and contains JPEG image with size less than 20 kb

###### Inputs:
  * Server's IP address
  * Server's primary port


##### Description 

The test starts the neighborhood initialization process with the profile server, which hosts a small number of profiles.


###### Step 1:

The tests obtains a list of service ports from the profile server's primary port.

The test creates a primary identity which it uses to simulate another profile server and then 
it creates the following test identities, establishes hosting agreements with the profile server for them, 
and initializes their profiles:

  * $profileInfo1 is `version := [1,0,0], type := "Profile Type A", name := "Shanghai 1",   image := "images/PS08003.jpg", location := (31.23, 121.47),  extraData = null`
  * $profileInfo2 is `version := [1,0,0], type := "Profile Type A", name := "Mumbai 1",     image := "images/PS08003.jpg", location := (18.96, 72.82),   extraData = "t=running,Cycling,ice hockey,water polo"`
  * $profileInfo3 is `version := [1,0,0], type := "Profile Type A", name := "Karachi",      image := null,                 location := (24.86, 67.01),   extraData = "l=Karachi,PK;a=iop://185f8db32271fe25f561a6fc938b2e264306ec304eda518007d1764826381969;t=traveling,cycling,running"`
  * $profileInfo4 is `version := [1,0,0], type := "Profile Type B", name := "Buenos Aires", image := "images/PS08003.jpg", location := (-34.61, -58.37), extraData = null`
  * $profileInfo5 is `version := [1,0,0], type := "Profile Type B", name := "Shanghai 2",   image := null,                 location := (31.231, 121.47), extraData = "running"`
  * $profileInfo6 is `version := [1,0,0], type := "Profile Type C", name := "Mumbai 2",     image := "images/PS08003.jpg", location := (18.961, 72.82),  extraData = "MTg1ZjhkYjMyMjcxZmUyNWY1NjFhNmZjOTM4YjJlMjY0MzA2ZWMzMDRlZGE1MTgwMDdkMTc2NDgyNjM4MTk2OQ=="`
  * $profileInfo7 is `version := [1,0,0], type := "Profile Type C", name := "Mumbai 3",     image := null,                 location := (18.961, 72.82),  extraData = "t=running;l=Mumbai,IN"`


###### Step 2:

The test connects to profile server's srNeighbor port and verifies its identity. 

The test sends *StartNeighborhoodInitializationRequest*:

  * `Message.id := 3`
  * `StartNeighborhoodInitializationRequest.primaryPort := 1`
  * `StartNeighborhoodInitializationRequest.srNeighborPort := 1`
 
and reads the response. Then it waits for *NeighborhoodSharedProfileUpdateRequest* message:

  * `$Id1 := Message.Id`

and replies with *NeighborhoodSharedProfileUpdateResponse*:

  * `Message.id := $Id1`

Then it waits for *FinishNeighborhoodInitializationRequest* message:

  * `$Id2 := Message.Id`

and replies with *FinishNeighborhoodInitializationResponse*:

  * `Message.id := $Id2`



##### Acceptance Criteria


###### Step 1:

The test successfully obtains list of ports on which the profile server provides its services. 
Then the test successfully establishes hosting agreements for its test identities.
Then the test successfully initializes all test profiles. 
Then the test successfully verifies its identity.


###### Step 2:

Server replies with *StartNeighborhoodInitializationResponse*:
  
  * `Message.id == 3`
  * `Response.status == STATUS_OK`

Server sends *NeighborhoodSharedProfileUpdateRequest*:

  * `NeighborhoodSharedProfileUpdateRequest.items == 
    (
      {ActionType = add, add {version, type, name, latitude, longitude, extradata match $profileInfo1; identityPublicKey is public key of test identity 1, setThumbnailImage == true, thumbnailImage != empty}},
      {ActionType = add, add {version, type, name, latitude, longitude, extradata match $profileInfo2; identityPublicKey is public key of test identity 2, setThumbnailImage == true, thumbnailImage != empty}},
      {ActionType = add, add {version, type, name, latitude, longitude, extradata match $profileInfo3; identityPublicKey is public key of test identity 3, setThumbnailImage == false, thumbnailImage == empty}},
      {ActionType = add, add {version, type, name, latitude, longitude, extradata match $profileInfo4; identityPublicKey is public key of test identity 4, setThumbnailImage == true, thumbnailImage != empty}},
      {ActionType = add, add {version, type, name, latitude, longitude, extradata match $profileInfo5; identityPublicKey is public key of test identity 5, setThumbnailImage == false, thumbnailImage == empty}},
      {ActionType = add, add {version, type, name, latitude, longitude, extradata match $profileInfo6; identityPublicKey is public key of test identity 6, setThumbnailImage == true, thumbnailImage != empty}},
      {ActionType = add, add {version, type, name, latitude, longitude, extradata match $profileInfo7; identityPublicKey is public key of test identity 7, setThumbnailImage == false, thumbnailImage == empty}},
    )`

Server sends *FinishNeighborhoodInitializationRequest*.
